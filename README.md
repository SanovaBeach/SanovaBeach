# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Laurence Balazo
I'm an aspiring front-end developer based in Philippines. Im learning ReactJS and anything about FrontEnd development. 
I love writing my own css, doing challenges from [frontendmentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges) and recently I've been trying [codewell](https://www.codewell.cc/). Doing it with only CSS/SCSS is really great and i'ts definitely helpful in my journey to become a Frontend developer.
